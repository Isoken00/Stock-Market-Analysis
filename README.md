# Stock-Market-Analysis
## Stock Market Analysis Prediction Using LSTM 
We will examine stock market statistics in this research, focusing on a few technological stocks. After learning how to use pandas to obtain stock information and visualize various elements of it, we'll look at a few methods for measuring a stock's risk based on its prior performance record.

âž¼ We will also use an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) approach to forecast Apple's closing stock values.

Along the journey, we'll respond to the following queries:

1. How much did the stock's price fluctuate over time?
2. What was the stock's average daily return?
3. What was the different stocks' moving average?
4. How did various stocks' correlations fare?
5. How much of our value is at danger when we buy a certain stock?
6. How can we try to forecast stock behavior in the future?
